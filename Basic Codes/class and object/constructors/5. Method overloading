/*
but in the above code in line 14, we can only pass two parameters and that too of int type. We get error if we try to assign more parameters.
This happens because, we created a method inside the class which takes exactly 2 parameters and that too of int type.
Thus, if we assign more parameters or if we assign data of different types as we dont have any method inside the class which accepts such data,
it gets error'

If we want to pass 3 parameters or if we want to pass any number of parameters or if we want to pass other data type parameters, we must have to create a 
method inside the class to accept such kind of data.

This is called as METHOD OVERLOADING
