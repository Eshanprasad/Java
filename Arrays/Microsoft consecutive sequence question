/*
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Microsoft.
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

//code starts here   [may be my code doesnt run in O(n) time complexity :(  but it works :)]
package practice;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class EshanClass {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] arr = {100, 2, 1, 200, 4, 3};
		Arrays.sort(arr);
		
		//original code starts here
		int[] array = new int[50];   //just an assumption of 100
		int count = 1;
		for(int i = 0; i<arr.length-1; i++) {
			if(arr[i] == arr[i+1] + 1)              // to avoid duplicates
				continue;
			if(arr[i+1] == arr[i]+  1)
				count++;
			else {
				array[i] = count;
				count = 1;
			}
		}
		array[49] = count;
		int max = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i<array.length; i++) {
			if(array[i]>max)
				max = array[i];
		}
		System.out.println(max);
